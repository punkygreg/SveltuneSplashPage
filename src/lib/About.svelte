      Traditional debugging tools weren't built for the dynamic nature of
      Svelte's state management, and the Svelte community lacks diverse
      debugging/testing applications opposed to other popular JS frameworks like
      React. That's why we created SvelteScope: a Svelte debugging and testing
      application designed to untangle the complexities of state and make
      testing a breeze.
